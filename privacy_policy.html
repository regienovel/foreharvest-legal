  <h1>ForeHarvest Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [2025-12-15]</p>

  <p>
    ForeHarvest ("we", "our", "us") provides agricultural guidance and planning tools.
    This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Approximate location (district-level):</strong> If you allow location access, the app uses your device location to help select your farming district (an area larger than 3 km²). We do not require precise GPS coordinates for core functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>App activity (optional analytics):</strong> If you enable analytics in the app settings, we may collect basic interaction events (e.g., feature usage) along with a random anonymous identifier to help improve the app.</li>
    <li><strong>User-generated content:</strong> If you use the “Ask” feature, the text you type is sent to our server to generate a response.</li>
    <li><strong>On-device settings:</strong> Your choices (language, selected district, crops, irrigation method, planting stage/date, cached advice, reminders) are stored locally on your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How we use data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App functionality:</strong> to tailor advice and forecasts to your district and settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics (optional):</strong> to understand which features are useful and improve stability and user experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. We do not share user data with third parties for advertising.
    Data is sent to our backend service providers solely to operate the app (e.g., to deliver advice responses).
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On-device data:</strong> stays on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Server processing:</strong> requests are processed to provide responses. Basic server logs may be retained for security and debugging for up to <strong>[X days]</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use encryption in transit (HTTPS) for network communication between the app and our backend.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your choices and controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can use the app without enabling analytics (if offered in settings).</li>
    <li>You can deny location permission and select your district manually (if the app provides manual selection).</li>
    <li>You can delete local app data using the in-app “Delete local data” option (if present) and/or by uninstalling the app or clearing app storage in Android settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data deletion requests</h2>
  <p>
    If you want us to delete any server-side data associated with your use of the app, contact us:
